The model spectrum can be generated by doing:

nf_struct = nf.run('figure_1.conf');
[f,P] = nf.spatial_spectrum(nf_struct,[],[],32,1);
loglog(f,P);

The analytic spectrum can be generated using the formulas provided in the
paper. The model parameters are stored in parameters.mat as objects using the
classes defined in corticothalamic-model repository. These
classes contain interfaces to generate the analytic spectrum shown in the
figures, and the relevant code is also included in the corticothalamic-model
directory (in dispersion_calc.m). However, this code has not been prepared for
general use yet and is essentially undocumented.

The remaining figures in the paper use the same model parameters, with
different noise amplitudes. These can be set by changing the ASD quantity of the
stimulus in the configuration file to match the quantity in the paper. For
example, Figure 2 is generated using mu = 1e-4, so figure_2.conf sould have a value of ASD
of 0.0001/sqrt(2). To generate Figure 5, simply change ASD to each of the specified mu
values in the figure caption divided by sqrt(2).
