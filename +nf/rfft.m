%% Fourier transform
%
% Heavily based on Chris Rennie's notes, see REFERENCES below.
%
% The normalization is such that sum(abs(y).^2)/length(y) = trapz(f,P)
%
% ARGUMENTS:
%        y  -- a 2D array of size (timepoints x N), where N is the number of signals/timeseries or traces.
%        fs -- sampling frequency (Hz) of the time series.
%        NFFT -- override the amount of zero padding in the FFT.
%        windowed  -- set as true to apply a Hamming window.
%        detrended -- set as true to remove any constant offset and linear trend.
%
% OUTPUT:
%        f -- frequency values
%        Y -- Fourier components, denoted c_k in Chris Rennie's notes.
%        P -- (fpts, N) Mean spectral power density, correct power is obtained by
%             integrating w.r.t. frequency values (f).
